## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A validator that crashes is no longer silently downgraded. `severity_cap` was
  rebuilding the `ValidatorResult` without carrying the `error` flag, so
  `PolicyEvaluator`'s fail-closed `error_count > 0 → HALT` path was bypassed: under
  `severity_cap: pass` a crashed validator became a `pass` and a token was issued,
  and under `severity_cap: warn` (used by the shipped `bugfix-surgeon` and
  `feature-warden` protocols) it was reported as a human-adjudicable `escalate`
  rather than `validator_error`. Error results are now never capped — a crash is an
  operational fault, not a severity judgement. The duplicate capping implementation
  in `engine/loop.py:_default_validator` now delegates to the shared runner, so
  capping exists in exactly one place.
- Task identifiers are stable across processes. `task_id` was derived from Python's
  `hash()` of the description, which is salted per interpreter, so the same
  description produced a different id on every run; `& 0xffffff` also truncated it
  to 24 bits, making collisions likely in the low thousands of tasks. Ids are now a
  48-bit SHA-256 digest via a single `derive_task_id()` helper in `snodo-core`,
  called from both `run_cmd` and `job_cmd`. Ids stored in existing sessions still
  resolve — `--retry` reads them rather than recomputing — so no migration is needed.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-21

Hardening pass over the enforcement core: five fail-open or silent-failure
defects, plus concurrency and durability fixes. Tracked as issues #5–#15;
decisions recorded in ADRs 014–016.

### Fixed

- The Kleene-closure driver (`run_to_closure`) no longer reports graph
  exceptions (coder/network/DB failures) as `resolved`. `resolved` now requires
  positive completion evidence (`is_complete`); a graph exception, a non-dict
  result, or a missing completion signal is reported as `internal_error` with a
  non-zero exit code and a `recovery_internal_error` audit event. LangGraph
  control-flow exceptions (`GraphInterrupt`/`GraphBubbleUp`) are propagated to
  the caller rather than swallowed.
- `snodo run` now emits the `--- STRUCTURED HALT PAYLOAD ---` block on the
  closure path (the primary execution path). The payload is built by the engine
  (single source of truth) and has `final_decision` equal to `halt_type`, using
  the canonical vocabulary (`escalate` / `blocker` / `validator_error` /
  `internal_error`). `validator_error` and `internal_error` no longer advise
  `snodo authorize`. The legacy single-invocation stream path was removed.
- Validation-token single-use is now enforced by a shared SQLite store
  (`~/.snodo/tokens.db`, overridable via `SNODO_TOKEN_STORE`). `consume_token`
  is called at the dispatch boundary (engine + MCP); the INSERT is an atomic
  claim across processes and survives restarts. Verification fails closed if
  the store is unavailable. An empty `SNODO_TOKEN_SECRET` is an error; an unset
  secret warns loudly.
- The audit log no longer silently truncates on load. `AuditLog` now raises
  `AuditError` (naming the offending line and log path, with recovery guidance)
  on a malformed line, hash mismatch, or sequence discontinuity instead of
  returning a partial list. Appends are refused onto an unverified chain, and
  `verify_chain()` now also checks that the on-disk log agrees with the
  in-memory chain, so a forked or truncated chain is never certified (INV4).
- Session writes are now atomic: `SessionManager._save_session` serialises to a
  same-directory `.tmp` file and `os.replace`s onto the target, so a crash
  mid-write leaves the previous session intact (INV5). Corrupt session files are
  no longer skipped silently — enumeration warns and audits (`session_corrupt`),
  and a corrupt *active* session raises `SessionError` instead of silently
  adopting a different session. State-file writes across `memory.py`, `recon`,
  and `jobs` now use `os.replace` (atomic overwrite on all platforms) instead of
  `os.rename`.
- The token store no longer fails with `database is locked` under concurrent
  dispatch. `busy_timeout` is now the first PRAGMA on every connection; the
  one-time DDL (WAL + `user_version` + `CREATE TABLE`) is serialized in-process
  and made idempotent (WAL and `user_version` are only written when they differ),
  and a failed `consume` (already-consumed token) now rolls back its implicit
  write transaction instead of holding the write lock. Concurrent consumers of
  the same token now resolve to exactly one winner without exceptions.
- The Kleene-closure driver no longer lets one over-deep sibling cancel the
  rest. A per-branch `max_recovery_depth` violation now records the exhausted
  child and `continue`s to the next sibling instead of `break`ing and zeroing
  the global `max_total_fix_attempts` budget. The parent is marked
  `recovery_exhausted` when any sibling is depth-exhausted (the closure is
  incomplete), but unrelated legal siblings still execute and consume exactly
  one budget unit each; genuine global exhaustion still stops processing.

## [0.2.0] – [0.5.4]

Released without individual changelog entries. See the git history
(`git log v0.1.0..v0.5.3`) for detail. Highlights across this range: the MCP
server (`snodo serve`), the TUI dashboard, the opencode coder adapter, the
Kleene-closure recovery loop (ADR 013), git-worktree task isolation, cloud audit
sync, background jobs, and the AGPL-3.0 → Apache-2.0 relicence.

> not a package release. Package versions and the citable artifact version are
> tracked on separate axes and are expected to differ.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-01

Initial public release.

### Core protocol engine
- Mode-based capability separation (producer, reviewer, planner)
- Validator quorums with disagreement policies (unanimous, majority, quorum, any)
- JWT-backed single-use validation tokens (WF1–INV5 invariant set)
- Session resumability with file-backed checkpointing
- ESCALATE resolution: halt → resolve → resume pattern
- Constraint predicate framework with two-phase evaluation
- Protocol adherence validator deriving mode profiles from operational primitives

### Protocol templates
- `solo`, `team`, and `2+n` templates ship with the package

### Interfaces
- CLI (`snodo`) with full command surface
- MCP server (`snodo serve`) for AI agent integration
- TUI dashboard (`snodo dashboard` / `snop`)

### Studies
- Policy Monte Carlo study
- Detection probability study
- Overhead benchmarks
- Byzantine robustness study
